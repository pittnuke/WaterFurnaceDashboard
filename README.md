# WaterFurnaceDashboard
A Customizable dashboard for displaying information about your Geothermal Water furnace built.

Inprogress build of a custom websocket based dashboard for monitoring and trending of information related to a Water Furnace Geothermal system. This websocket will be built using Node.js, CSS, and HTML. When finished my goal is to have this a pre-built docker container to host the web dashboard.

This project is built upon the work done by CCutrer. See his project at https://github.com/ccutrer/waterfurnace_aurora. Without out the work he has done, this project wouldn't be possible. Please go buy him a Coffee (link in his project) to thank him.
